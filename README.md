OceanPulse

OceanPulse is an advanced version of a Java and JavaFX-based Point of Sale System (POSS), originally developed as a first-semester final project. This updated project has been restructured to utilize layered architecture and several design patterns to improve its scalability, maintainability, and overall design.

Features

    Layered Architecture: The application is now organized into distinct layers, including Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access, to enhance modularity and separation of concerns.
    Factory Design Pattern: Used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created, promoting loose coupling and flexibility in object creation.
    Strategy Design Pattern: Implemented to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable, allowing for dynamic algorithm selection based on context.
    Facade Design Pattern: Applied to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to interact with various components of the application.
    Singleton Design Pattern: Utilized to ensure a single instance of certain classes, managing global state and providing a single point of access.
